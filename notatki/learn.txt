Dart's functions are first class objects, 
everything is a widget - for ex. ChangeNotifier (notifyListeners)
flutter pub add provider
model vs service 
We know that the Model layer components are invoked inside the Controller layer. Once the latter is built, you come to realize that it doesn't look concise (messy with dirty code); the Controller may not afford extra details (e.g. formatting request parameters before calling a DAO method that are going to consume them ...). Therefore, you might include this extra layer, namely the Service layer
ChangeNotifierProvider, Consumer, Provider.of
